Steps Followed:

Initialized a new Node.js project using npm init.

Installed ESLint using npm install eslint --save-dev.

Configured ESLint using npx eslint --init, selecting the option to check syntax, find problems, and enforce code style.

Modified the ESLint configuration in .eslintrc.js to extend the airbnb configuration and added custom rules for semi-colons and quotes.

Ran into an issue where ESLint couldn't find the eslint-config-airbnb package. Resolved it by installing eslint-config-airbnb using npm install eslint-config-airbnb --save-dev.

Updated the rules section in .eslintrc.js to wrap rule keys in quotes for consistency.

Observations:

ESLint is a powerful tool that helps maintain code quality by enforcing coding standards, identifying syntax errors, and catching potential issues early in the development process.
